# TODO

This is a list of open things to implement.

- Use GIMP to cut Switch.png into smaller chunks (by switch and state)
- Implement a raf (request animation frame)
- Write some prose (see below)
- Display checkboxes on the UI for guessing
- Level design
- Highscores in the shape of minutes counting down
- Sound of dial-in with 56k modem

## Gameplay

The Internet broke down, so you are offline.
But you remember that there was a way to connect to an alternative dial by
several smaller computers, so you have to overcome their firewall by playing
some mini games.
For example, solving a mastermind.
Or some puzzle game (pipes with water or what not)
Or maze games
Or rhythm games

Display switches for changing the state.
Some LEDs could indicate the solution (guessed right resp. wrong position).
